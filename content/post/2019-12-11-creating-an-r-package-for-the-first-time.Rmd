Recently, I was creating an R package for the first time^[Technically, it's not really my first time. I think I had to make one for a class a few years ago, but naturally, I don't remember much from it.]. There are a lot of great resources online that I relied on, such as the [Hilary Parker's brief tutorial](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/) or [Jeff Leek's guide](https://github.com/jtleek/rpackages). But I thought it would still be worthwhile to walk through how exactly I made mine and what hiccups I ran into, since I am likely to be creating another R package in the near future.

# Step 1: Set up your packages and directory

# Step 2: Write DESCRIPTION

# Step 3: Add functions

# Step 4: Write documentation

# Step 5: Install your package

# Step 6: Write tests?
