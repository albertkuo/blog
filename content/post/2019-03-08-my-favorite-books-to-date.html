<p>I sometimes get requests for book recommendations, so I decided to write a post on my favorite books.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> For each book, I give a very short description (&lt; 3 sentences) of the book and why I enjoyed it. Hopefully, it’ll give you some idea of whether you’ll want to read it too.</p>
<p>You might also be interested in following the books I read with my friend Kevin on our <a href="https://albertandkevin.wordpress.com">reading blog</a>, where we review every book we read (both the good and the bad).</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2amA7J5">Sapiens</a></strong> by Yuval Noah Harari</li>
</ol>
<p>Harari tells a captivating story about how humans became the dominant species on the planet, with sweeping and intuitive explanations on a wide range of topics. The book inspires you to think about society and human history from a broad perspective, which I think would’ve been hard to do on my own.</p>

</div>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/1ZI0bNK">The New Jim Crow</a></strong> by Michelle Alexander</li>
</ol>
<p>This was an incredibly eye-opening book for me. Alexander describes how the current justice system in America has (intentionally!) been set up to legitimize racial discrimination in present society; that many remain unaware of its extent shows how horrifyingly successful the “new Jim Crow” has been. It’s a must-read for everyone in America (and worth perusing for everyone else too).</p>

<p><img src="/img/a-little-life.jpg" alt="a-little-life.jpg" height=300px></p>
</div>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2UpqnjS">A Little Life</a></strong> by Hanya Yanagihara</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve never felt like I lived an entire life from reading a book until I read <em>A Little Life</em>. It was some life too – the characters are so heartachingly beautiful and the story so emotional that when it all comes to an end, all you can say is <em>wow</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/img/when-breath-becomes-air.jpg" alt="when-breath-becomes-air.jpg" height=300px></p>
</div>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2b3rrEh">When Breath Becomes Air</a></strong> by Paul Kalanithi</li>
</ol>
<p>Kalanithi is a doctor who has to suddenly come to terms with his mortality when diagnosed with cancer. It’s a wonderful memoir and could not have been written in a more intelligent, thoughtful, and thought-provoking manner. I’ve set a reminder for myself to reread this book at a future date, so yes, I think it’s definitely worth reading at least once.</p>
<div class="go-center">
<p><img src="/img/the-righteous-mind.jpg" alt="the-righteous-mind.jpg" height=300px></p>
</div>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/29Xp6t6">The Righteous Mind</a></strong> by Jonathan Haidt</li>
</ol>
<p>Jonathan writes a thought-provoking book for anyone interested in politics. He describes a moral basis that gives rise to differences in conservative and liberal opinions, which by its mere formulation, goes a long way towards combating the instinctive demonization common in political discourse.</p>
