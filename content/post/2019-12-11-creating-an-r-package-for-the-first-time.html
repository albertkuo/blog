<p>Recently, I was creating an R package for the first time<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. There are a lot of great resources online that I relied on, such as the <a href="https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/">Hilary Parker’s brief tutorial</a> or <a href="https://github.com/jtleek/rpackages">Jeff Leek’s guide</a>. But I thought it would still be worthwhile to walk through how exactly I made mine and what hiccups I ran into, since I am likely to be creating another R package in the near future.</p>
