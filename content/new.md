I blog about whatever I think would be of interest to my field (biostatistics) and current position (PhD student).

This includes various guides/tutorials on things I'm learning, like [using R Markdown](/post/getting-started-with-r-markdown/), [writing an R package](/post/creating-an-r-package-for-the-first-time/), and [running parallel jobs on a cluster](/post/submitting-parallel-jobs-on-a-cluster/).

For advice on the PhD program, I've written about [whether you should get a PhD](/post/should-you-get-a-phd-in-biostatistics/), [what you can do to prepare](/post/advice-for-prospective-phd-students-in-biostatistics/), and [how my preliminary oral exam went](/post/my-preliminary-oral-exam/).

Or if you are just browsing, feel free to head on over to [posts](/post) and see if any of the titles interest you.
