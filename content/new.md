I blog about whatever I think would be of interest to my field (biostatistics) and position (graduate student).

This includes guides/tutorials on things I'm learning as a PhD student, like [using R Markdown](https://blog.albertkuo.me/post/getting-started-with-r-markdown/), [creating an R package](https://blog.albertkuo.me/post/creating-an-r-package-for-the-first-time/), and [running parallel jobs on a cluster](https://blog.albertkuo.me/post/submitting-parallel-jobs-on-a-cluster/).

I've also written about my favorite [books](https://blog.albertkuo.me/post/my-favorite-books-to-date/) and [R packages](https://blog.albertkuo.me/post/a-few-of-my-favorite-r-packages/).

But since my blog is still young, I haven't written very many posts in total. So if you are just browsing, feel free to head on over to [posts](/post) and see if any of the titles interest you. I hope that most of my posts are useful and/or interesting.
