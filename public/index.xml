      <title>Point Shape Options in ggplot</title>

      <description>I’m familiar enough with ggplot that I can make a quick plot pretty easily in most cases.1 But when it comes to the various plot aesthetics, like adjusting the legend position or rotating axis tick labels, I always have to look them up. Today, I will be writing about one of these pesky things: looking up the point shape options for geom_point. I feel like the available documentation for this isn’t great, so I’m writing my own reference.</description>

      <title>Submitting Parallel Jobs on a Cluster</title>

      <description>Recently, I’ve been running simulations on our school’s computing cluster (JHPCE), which schedules jobs using the Open Grid Engine. Each simulation takes about half a day to complete, so I could run them sequentially and wait a week to get 14 simulation points. Or I could run them in parallel and get 14 simulation points in less than a day!
In theory, running my simulations in parallel should be a very straightforward task.</description>

      <title>Should I get a PhD (in biostatistics)?</title>

      <description>During the process of applying to graduate school, I was honestly still unsure about whether getting a PhD was a good idea. So from time to time, I would Google, “should I get a PhD” and see what I find. Chances are, if you’re reading this post, you’re in a similar boat. Now that I’ve started my PhD, I have a better idea of whether getting a PhD is a good choice for me.</description>

      <title>My Favorite Books to Date</title>

      <description>I sometimes get requests for book recommendations, so I decided to write a post on my favorite books.1 For each book, I give a very short description (&amp;lt; 3 sentences) of the book and why I enjoyed it. Hopefully, it’ll give you some idea of whether you’ll want to read it too.
You might also be interested in following the books I read with my friend Kevin on our reading blog, where we review every book we read (both the good and the bad).</description>

      <title>Setting Up My Blog: Why I Chose Hugo Over Jekyll</title>

      <description>I’ve been reading a lot of people’s blogs in the statistics/data science world lately and it made me start thinking about things that I wanted to write about and share. So here we are – my first post! Hello world!
Before I could write anything, I had to decide on how I was going to build and host the blog. For my personal website, I already use Jekyll, so it seemed natural to build my blog as part of my website.</description>
