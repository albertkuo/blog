      <description>I sometimes get requests for book recommendations, so I decided to write a post on my favorite books.1 For each book, I give a very short description (&amp;lt; 3 sentences) of the book and why I enjoyed it. Hopefully, it’ll give you some idea of whether you’ll want to read it too.
You might also be interested in following the books I read with my friend Kevin on our reading blog, where we review every book we read (both the good and the bad).</description>
