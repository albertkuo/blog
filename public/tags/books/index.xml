      <description>I sometimes get requests for book recommendations, so I decided to write a post on my favorite books.1 For each book, I give a very short description (&amp;lt; 3 sentences) of the book and why I enjoyed it. Hopefully, thatâ€™ll give you some idea of whether you want to read it too.
A quick plug: you might also be interested in following the books I read with my friend Kevin on our reading blog.</description>
