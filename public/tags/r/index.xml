      <description>I just finished my second year in the PhD program, which has meant 2 years of writing a lot of R code. Though I’ve been using R longer than that, I’m always trying to improve my programming skills. Today, I wanted to share some useful R packages/functions that have made my life easier and changed the way I code.
pacman for loading packages:  This package contains an awesome function called p_load.</description>

      <title>Point Shape Options in ggplot</title>

      <description>I’m familiar enough with ggplot that I can make a quick plot pretty easily in most cases.1 But when it comes to fine-tuning the various plot aesthetics, like adjusting the legend position or rotating axis tick labels, I always have to look them up. Today, I will be writing about one of these pesky things: looking up the point shape options for geom_point. The available documentation for this isn’t great, so I thought it would be worthwhile to write my own reference.</description>

      <description>Recently, I’ve been running simulations on our school’s computing cluster (JHPCE), which schedules jobs using the Open Grid Engine. Each simulation takes about half a day to complete, so I could run them sequentially and wait a week to get 14 simulation points. Or I could run them in parallel and get 14 simulation points in less than a day!
In theory, running my simulations in parallel should be a very straightforward task.</description>
