      <description>Your favorite NBA team is down 17 points and there are only 12 minutes left in the quarter. What is the probability that they pull a comeback and win the game? This kind of question is one that I frequently have while watching basketball and one that I’ve always felt should be answerable. I’ve found that sports commentary loves to provide arbitrary, super specific statistics (e.g. no team has won Game 7 of an Eastern Conference final after being outscored in the first half and losing Game 6 by a margin more than 10 points), I suspected that the data I needed exists somewhere – all I need, quite simply, is a minute-by-minute points breakdown of previous NBA games.</description>

      <description>On campaign trails across the U.S., the same message is often repeated: vote! Their goal is to encourage more people to vote, especially the people who are likely to vote for them. But which party benefits more from increasing overall voter turnout? The conventional wisdom today is that it benefits the Democratic party more than the Republican party. This is based on the working knowledge that young people of color are believed to have lower voting turnouts and are also more likely to vote for Democratic candidates.</description>

      <title>10 Tips and Tricks for Statistical Proofs</title>

      <description>I’ve been taking probability theory this year and I noticed that a lot of proofs will assume that the reader already knows some commonly used “tricks.” If you aren’t familiar with them, it can be hard to follow the proofs in the textbook,1 let alone prove it yourself. I felt like this was happening to me a lot, so in an effort to better familiarize myself, I’ve written down some useful tips and tricks, along with explanations and/or examples.</description>
