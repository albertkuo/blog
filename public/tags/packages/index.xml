      <description>I just finished my second year in the PhD program, which has meant 2 years of writing a lot of R code. Though I’ve been using R longer than that, I’m always trying to improve my programming skills. Today, I wanted to share some useful R packages/functions that have made my life easier and changed the way I code.
pacman for loading packages:  This package contains an awesome function called p_load.</description>
