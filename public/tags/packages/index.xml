      <description>I just finished my second year in the PhD program, which means 2 years of writing a lot of R code. Today, I wanted to share some useful (and perhaps lesser known) R packages that I use.
pacman for loading packages:  This package contains an awesome function called p_load. I prefer the concise way it lets you load packages, as opposed to writing library(package) over and over again. Moreover, p_load automatically checks if you have installed the package and if you havenâ€™t, installs it for you from CRAN.</description>
