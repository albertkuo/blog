      <description>Recently, I was creating an R package for the first time.1 There are already a lot of great resources online for this task, such as Hilary Parker’s brief tutorial or Jeff Leek’s guide or Hadley Wickham’s book (in increasing order of detail).2 But I thought it would still be worthwhile to walk through how exactly I made mine, since otherwise, I will probably run into the same hiccups again (and be frustrated that I didn’t write a guide for myself!</description>

      <description>I just finished my second year in the PhD program, which means 2 years of writing a lot of R code. Today, I wanted to share some useful (and perhaps lesser known) R packages that I use.
pacman for loading packages:  This package contains an awesome function called p_load. I prefer the concise way it lets you load packages, as opposed to writing library(package) over and over again. Moreover, p_load automatically checks if you have installed the package and if you haven’t, installs it for you from CRAN.</description>
