      <description>Annoying alert that disk space is running low (2-3 GB left of memory!) Checking mac storage - manage, removed some applications I rarely use (only bought me a few GB). But it unhelpfully tells me that 60GB was in “System.” To find out what is in System, use utility called Disk Inventory X and discovered some things I still have old R version 3.4 and 3.5 (a few GB) the MacTex distribution takes up a lot of space (in addition to the 2016 version, I even still had the old versions 2014, 2015).</description>
