      <description>Although SQL is commonly used in industry, it’s not something that’s often used or taught in academia. I learned it on my own a few years ago, but since I don’t use it regularly, it’s hard to retain. To resolve this, I’ve created the following guide for basic SQL commands along with their equivalents in R/dplyr. Hopefully, this will allow me to pick it back up again more quickly in the future.</description>
