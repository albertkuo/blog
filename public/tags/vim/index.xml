      <description>Even though vim has been my default text editor for a couple of years now, I’m still woefully ignorant about how to actually use it.

Nonetheless, I tried to rectify this shortcoming a few months ago by changing my RStudio settings to “vim mode” and forcing myself to use vim commands all the time.</description>
