      <description>It’s application season for graduate admissions again! As a current PhD student, I thought I would share some advice for prospective students. I’d previously written on whether you should get a PhD. In this post, I will talk about things you can do to prepare for a biostatistics PhD and the application process. As with any advice I give on this blog, it is based on my personal experience – I was a math and statistics major in undergrad at UChicago and I’m now a biostatistics PhD student at Johns Hopkins – so your mileage may vary.</description>

      <title>Experiences as a Senior PhD Student</title>

      <description>Today, I wanted to write about the transition from the early stages to the later stages of a biostatistics PhD program and talk more about my experience. Currently, I’m in my 4th year of the biostats PhD program at Johns Hopkins, which means that I have about 1-2 years left in my (5-year) program. I’ve touched upon some of what being a PhD student is like in a previous post, but I think an “update” is due because the day-to-day experience does change quite dramatically as you progress in your PhD.</description>

      <title>Clearing Out Space in My Macbook</title>

      <description>Annoying alert that disk space is running low (2-3 GB left of memory!) Checking mac storage - manage, removed some applications I rarely use (only bought me a few GB). But it unhelpfully tells me that 60GB was in “System.” To find out what is in System, use utility called Disk Inventory X and discovered some things I still have old R version 3.4 and 3.5 (a few GB) the MacTex distribution takes up a lot of space (in addition to the 2016 version, I even still had the old versions 2014, 2015).</description>

      <title>Should You Get a PhD (in biostatistics)?</title>

      <description>Throughout the process of applying to graduate school, I felt unsure about whether getting a PhD was a good idea. I remember Googling “should I get a PhD” just to see what I could find out of curiosity. Chances are, if you’re reading this post, you’re in a similar boat. As a now second-year PhD student in biostatistics, I think I have a better idea of whether being in a PhD program has been a good choice for me and I’ll share what I think would’ve been useful for me to know back when I was applying.</description>
