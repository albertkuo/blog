      <description>I’m familiar enough with ggplot that I can make a quick plot pretty easily in most cases.1 But when it comes to fine-tuning the various plot aesthetics, like adjusting the legend position or rotating axis tick labels, I always have to look them up. Today, I will be writing about one of these pesky things: looking up the point shape options for geom_point. The available documentation for this isn’t great, so I thought it would be worthwhile to write my own reference.</description>

      <title>Submitting Parallel Jobs on a Cluster</title>

      <description>Recently, I’ve been running simulations on our school’s computing cluster (JHPCE), which schedules jobs using the Open Grid Engine. Each simulation takes about half a day to complete, so I could run them sequentially and wait a week to get 14 simulation points. Or I could run them in parallel and get 14 simulation points in less than a day!
In theory, running my simulations in parallel should be a very straightforward task.</description>

      <title>Setting Up My Blog: Why I Chose Hugo Over Jekyll</title>

      <description>I’ve been reading a lot of people’s blogs in the statistics/data science world lately and it made me start thinking about things that I wanted to write about and share. So here we are – my first post! Hello world!
Before I could write anything, I had to decide on how I was going to build and host the blog. For my personal website, I already use Jekyll, so it seemed natural to build my blog as part of my website.</description>
