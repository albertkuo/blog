There are already a lot of great resources^[For example, [Hilary Parker's brief tutorial](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/) or [Jeff Leek's guide](https://github.com/jtleek/rpackages) or [Karl Broman's tutorial](https://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/) or [Hadley Wickham's book](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/intro.html) (in increasing order of detail).] that teach you how to make an R package. But I thought it would still be worthwhile to walk through how I created my first one -- at the very least, it'll be helpful for myself when I write my next R package.

Here is my step-by-step guide to building a (minimally functional) R package.

## Step 1: Set up your packages and directory

To create your own R package, you will need to use two packages, `devtools` and `roxygen2`. `devtools` contains the functions for building a package, while `roxygen2` helps generate documentation for the package using specially formatted comments.

```{r eval = F}
library(devtools)
library(roxygen2)
```

Now navigate to the parent directory of where you want your R package directory to be located (e.g. `R_packages`). Use the function `devtools::create`^[In general, I don't like specifying the package name when using functions because it is a lot of extra characters to type out. So I won't do that in the code chunks of this blog post either, unless I think there is good reason to. However, I will try to do so when describing the functions in this blog post to prevent any ambiguity.] to create the folder for the R package, which I will call `mypackage` in this tutorial.

```{r eval = F}
setwd("R_packages")
create("mypackage")
```

Your `R_packages/mypackage` directory should now look like the following:

![Contents of `mypackage`:](/post/2019-12-11-creating-an-r-package-for-the-first-time_files/file_structure.png)

* `DESCRIPTION` - information about the package
* `mypackage.Rproj` - the Rproj file
* `NAMESPACE` - information about what to import and export
* `R` - a directory for your scripts, i.e. where your functions will go 

At this point, you can (should) create a git repository and connect it to GitHub. Navigate to https://github.com and create a new repository there with the same name (e.g. "mypackage"). Then run the following commands in your terminal.

```{bash eval = F}
cd mypackage # Navigate to mypackage directory
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/albertkuo/mypackage.git
git add *
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin master
```

Aside from the usual benefits that come with using version control, making your R package a GitHub repo means that later on, other people can easily install your package directly from GitHub (see Step 6).

## Step 2: Write DESCRIPTION

Now edit DESCRIPTION with your favorite text editor. This file basically contains some information about the package. Below is an example (you will have to remove the "# comments" in your actual DESCRIPTION file).

```{bash eval = F}
Package: mypackage
Title: What the Package Does # One line only, Title Case, and no period
Version: 0.1.0 # see Jeff Leek's versioning convention
Date: 2019-12-14
Authors@R: c(person(given = "Albert",
                    family = "Kuo",
                    role = c("aut", "cre"), # "aut" means author (someone who has 
                                            # made a significant contribution) 
                                            # "cre" means maintainer (who to 
                                            # contact if there are problems)
                    email = "albertkuo@jhu.edu",
                    comment = c("ORCID" = "0000-0001-5155-0748")))
Depends: R (>= 3.6.0)
Imports: dplyr # packages you need for the package, aka dependencies
Suggests: knitr # optional packages that aren't strictly needed
Description: What the package does, with more detail. # one paragraph
License: GPL-3
Encoding: UTF-8
LazyData: true
```

Note: The GPL-3 license seems to be a commonly recommended license for R packages. I found [this guide](https://blog.codinghorror.com/pick-a-license-any-license/) to be a helpful start if you want to learn more about software licenses.

## Step 3: Add functions and write documentation

It's likely that you already have functions that you want to create a package for. Copy them into the `R` folder. Each function should be in its own separate file.^[This is not a requirement, but it is good practice.]

Let's say you have a script called `my_function.R`. We want to write specially formatted comments for it so that `roxygen2` can automatically build the documentation pages. Below is an example.

```{r eval = F}
#' A very brief description of what your function does
#'
#' A detailed description of what the function does.
#'
#' @param print_statement a logical value indicating 
#' whether to print the statement (default is \code{TRUE})
#'
#' @import dplyr
#'
#' @export
#' 
#' @return \code{my_function} prints a declaration 
#' announcing itself if the parameter is \code{TRUE}
#'
#' @examples
#' R code examples of how to use your function
#'
my_function <- function(print_statement = TRUE){
  if(print_statement){
    print("This is my function.")
  }
}
```

Some things I want to draw your attention to:

* Include `@export` if you want the function to be exported, i.e. visible to people who use the R package.
* Include `@import` for any packages that are needed for this function. You can also import a specific function with `@importFrom` to prevent name conflicts (e.g. `@importFrom MASS lda`).

Now we can generate the documentation files and NAMESPACE using `roxygen2`.^[Technically, we will call it via the wrapper function `devtools::document()`.] This is as easy as typing the following command.

```{r eval = F}
document()
```

Your `R_packages/mypackage` directory should now look like the following:

![Contents of `mypackage`](/post/2019-12-11-creating-an-r-package-for-the-first-time_files/file_structure_2.png)

The documentation files are the help files that can be accessed by typing `?myfunction`. They are located in the `man/` directory. 

The NAMESPACE file tells you which functions you are exporting from your package and which packages/functions you are importing to be used in your package.

Every time you make changes to the comments, you will want to regenerate the documentation and NAMESPACE with the `devtools::document()` command. 

## (Optional) Step 4: Add internal data

Something that you might want to do is to use data internally within your R package. For example, your functions might require the use of some internal data that you want to load.

To do this, first run the following command.

```{r eval = F}
use_data_raw("generate_internal")
```

This will create an R script in `data-raw/generate_internal.R`, where you can put your code that generates the internal data. It will also add the `data-raw/` directory to .Rbuildignore, since you won't need it to build the package.

Then in `generate_internal.R`, you can generate and save the internal data.

```{r eval = F}
# Generate data
x = 1:5
y = 1:10

# Save data
usethis::use_data(x, y, internal = TRUE)
```

The command `usethis::use_data` will save the objects `x` and `y` in `R/sysdata.rda`, which is a file specifically designed to hold internal data. Your functions will then be able to call the objects `x` and `y` whenever they are needed.

## Step 5: Install your package

Believe it or not, your package is ready to be installed locally on your computer. This is simple to do with the `devtools::install()` command.

```{r eval = F}
install()
library(mypackage)
```

Your package is now ready to be used! Any functions you've exported are available. For example, type `my_function()`. You can also access the help page you generated in Step 3, just like you would do with any other package's functions, by typing `?my_function`.

## Step 6: Share your package

If you have made your R package folder into a git repo (as discussed in Step 1) and pushed your changes to GitHub, then anyone can install your R package directly from GitHub using the `devtools::install_github` command. For example, the R package I've been creating for this blog post can be found at the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/albertkuo/mypackage) and installed with the following command.

```{r eval = F}
devtools::install_github("albertkuo/mypackage")
```

You can also build the package, i.e. bundle it into a single `tar.gz` file, with the command `devtools::build()`. This file can then be shared and installed by other users using the standard `install.packages()` command (make sure you specify that `repos = NULL` in order to install from the local file).

```{r eval = F}
build() # will put tar.gz in parent directory by default
install.packages("../mypackage_0.1.0.tar.gz", repos = NULL)
```

## Future work

At this point, you have a basic R package that can be easily distributed. Even if you don't share it with anyone, this is a great way to organize and use your own functions.^[Or so I have heard. By default, I still source an R script of helper functions for my projects, but perhaps this will change as I become more comfortable with building R packages.]

To turn your R package into something more user-friendly, however, there are a couple more things you will want to do. One of them is to write tests for your R package to check for bugs and to "[dummy proof](https://github.com/jtleek/rpackages)" your functions. Another is to write vignettes to help people learn how to use your R package. Since these things go beyond what is strictly necessary for a functional R package,^[And it's likely to be more than what I would be able to do in one day.] I will write about them in a later post.
