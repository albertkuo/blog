I sometimes get requests for book recommendations, so I decided to write a post on my favorite books.^[Excluding childhood favorites.] For each book, I give a very short description (< 3 sentences) of the book and why I enjoyed it. Hopefully, that'll give you some idea of whether you want to read it too. 

A quick plug: you might also be interested in following the books I read with my friend Kevin on our [reading blog](https://albertandkevin.wordpress.com).

1. **[Sapiens](https://amzn.to/2amA7J5)** by Yuval Noah Harari

Harari tells a captivating story about how humans became the dominant species on the planet, with sweeping and intuitive explanations on a wide range of topics. Reading this book inspires you to think about society and human history from a broad perspective, in a way that is otherwise hard to do on your own.

2. **[The New Jim Crow](https://amzn.to/1ZI0bNK)** by Michelle Alexander

This was an incredibly eye-opening book for me. Alexander describes how the current justice system in America has (intentionally!) been set up to legitimize racial discrimination in present society; the fact that many remain unaware of its extent shows how horrifyingly successful the "new Jim Crow" has been. It's a must-read for everyone living in America (and worth perusing for everyone else too).

3. **[A Little Life](https://amzn.to/2UpqnjS)** by Hanya Yanagihara

I've never felt like I lived an entire life from reading a book until I read *A Little Life*. The characters are so heartachingly beautiful and the story is so immersive and emotional that when it all comes to an end, all you can say is wow, that was some story.

4. **[When Breath Becomes Air](https://amzn.to/2b3rrEh)** by Paul Kalanithi

Kalanithi is a doctor who has to suddenly come to terms with his mortality when diagnosed with cancer. It's a wonderful memoir written in a highly intelligent, thoughtful, and thought-provoking manner. I've set a reminder for myself to reread this book at a future date, so yes, I think it's definitely worth reading at least once.

5. **[The Righteous Mind](https://amzn.to/29Xp6t6)** by Jonathan Haidt

Jonathan writes a thought-provoking book about how we form our political opinions. He shows how differences in conservative and liberal thought can be explained by a moral basis, which by its mere formulation, goes a long way towards combating the instinctive demonization common in political discourse.
