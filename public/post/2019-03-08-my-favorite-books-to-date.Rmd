I sometimes get requests for book recommendations, so I decided to write a post on my favorite books.^[Excluding childhood favorites.] For each book, I give a very short description (< 3 sentences) of the book and why I enjoyed it. Hopefully, it'll give you some idea of whether you'll want to read it too. 

You might also be interested in following the books I read with my friend Kevin on our [reading blog](https://albertandkevin.wordpress.com), where we review every book we read (both the good and the bad).

1. **[Sapiens](https://amzn.to/2amA7J5)** by Yuval Noah Harari

Harari tells a captivating story about how humans became the dominant species on the planet, with sweeping and intuitive explanations on a wide range of topics. The book inspires you to think about society and human history from a broad perspective, which I think would've been hard to do on my own.

2. **[The New Jim Crow](https://amzn.to/1ZI0bNK)** by Michelle Alexander

This was an incredibly eye-opening book for me. Alexander describes how the current justice system in America has (intentionally!) been set up to legitimize racial discrimination in present society; that many remain unaware of its extent shows how horrifyingly successful the "new Jim Crow" has been. It's a must-read for everyone in America (and worth perusing for everyone else too).

3. **[A Little Life](https://amzn.to/2UpqnjS)** by Hanya Yanagihara

I've never felt like I lived an entire life from reading a book until I read *A Little Life*. It was some life too -- the characters are so heartachingly beautiful and the story so emotional that when it all comes to an end, all you can say is *wow*.

4. **[When Breath Becomes Air](https://amzn.to/2b3rrEh)** by Paul Kalanithi

Kalanithi is a doctor who has to suddenly come to terms with his mortality when diagnosed with cancer. It's a wonderful memoir and could not have been written in a more intelligent, thoughtful, and thought-provoking manner. I've set a reminder for myself to reread this book at a future date, so yes, I think it's definitely worth reading at least once.

5. **[The Righteous Mind](https://amzn.to/29Xp6t6)** by Jonathan Haidt

Jonathan writes a thought-provoking book for anyone interested in politics. He describes a moral basis that gives rise to differences in conservative and liberal opinions, which by its mere formulation, goes a long way towards combating the instinctive demonization common in political discourse.
