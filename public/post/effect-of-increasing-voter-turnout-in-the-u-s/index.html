<p>On campaign trails across the U.S., the same message is often repeated: vote! Their goal is to encourage more people to vote, especially the people who are likely to vote for them. But which party benefits more from increasing overall voter turnout? The conventional wisdom today is that it benefits the Democratic party more than the Republican party. This is based on the working knowledge that young people of color are believed to have lower voting turnouts and are also more likely to vote for Democratic candidates. Therefore, it’s reasonable to hypothesize that increasing voting turnout would lead to more votes for the Democratic party.</p>
<p>I was interested, however, in actually quantifying how big this effect is. If everyone voted, what would be the election results on a state-by-state basis? To my surprise, I couldn’t find this information online, so I decided to do my own analysis.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<div id="results" class="section level1">
<h1>Results</h1>
<p><strong>tl;dr: Increasing voter turnout does in fact benefit the Democratic party. But the effect is smaller than I expected.</strong></p>
<p>Below, I’ve plotted the actual 2016 presidential election results (light blue points) versus what the election results might have looked like if everyone had voted (dark blue points). Panel (a) is for all states and panel (b) is the same plot showing only “swing” states, which are particularly important in the election due to how the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_College_(United_States)">U.S. electoral college</a> works.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2020-08-25-effect-of-increasing-voter-turnout-in-the-u-s_files/election_2016_plot.png" /></p>
<p>Based on my analysis, four states would have flipped from Republican to Democrat: Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida, and Pennsylvania. This is a difference of 75 electoral votes, which would have been more than enough to elect Hillary Clinton instead of Donald Trump (only 37 electoral votes are needed). But this is assuming that <em>everyone</em> voted. It’s much more likely that any voluntary increase in turnout would be far more modest. For instance, the voter turnout among black voters was 60% in 2016 presidential election. In 2008, the year in which the first ever black president, Barack Obama, was elected, the voter turnout among black voters was 69% (Data source #2). If the overall voter turnout only increases by about 10%, then it’s likely that only Michigan would have flipped, which means that Donald Trump would have still been elected.</p>
<p>Political candidates may succeed in increasing voter turnout specifically among voters more favorable to them. In fact, this was the case in 2008 for Barack Obama. As I mentioned earlier, the black vote turnout was about 10% higher in 2008 compared to 2016. In contrast, it was only 1-2% higher for other racial groups: White, Hispanic, and Asian (Data sources #2, 5). However, even if we use the race-specific voter turnout rate from 2008, it’s still true that only Michigan would have flipped.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2020-08-25-effect-of-increasing-voter-turnout-in-the-u-s_files/election_2016_plot_2.png" /></p>
<p>Having said that, no one knows how tight the margins will be for every new election. If more states end up looking like Michigan in the upcoming 2020 election, how high the voter turnout is could be a deciding factor. For example, there is evidence that the changing demographics in the U.S. are favorable to the Democratic party. If we take the party preferences and turnout of 2016 and the demographics of 2019, we would see the following plot.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2020-08-25-effect-of-increasing-voter-turnout-in-the-u-s_files/election_2019_plot.png" /></p>
<p>Wisconsin, Florida, and Pennsylvania are now predicted to have vote ratios closer to the boundary of 0.5 and it’s more likely that increasing voter turnout might flip those states from Republican to Democrat.</p>
<p>In summary, I think that it’s unlikely that any reasonable increase in voter turnout would have changed the 2016 election results. However, that doesn’t mean it won’t make a difference in the 2020 election.</p>

<h1>Analysis details</h1>
<p>If you’re interested in how I did my analysis, keep reading on.</p>
<div id="party-preference-and-turnout-by-demographic-groups" class="section level2">
<h2>Party preference and turnout by demographic groups</h2>
<p>To understand how increasing the voter turnout is going to affect the results, I collected data on two things: the current turnout rate (i.e. What % of a demographic group voted?) and the party preference (i.e. What is the ratio of Republican vs Democratic votes for this demographic group?). I did this for 3 demographic variables: sex, age, and race.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Sex
sex_tb = tibble(sex = c(&quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;),
                party_pref_sex = c(52/41, 39/54), # Data source #1
                turnout_sex = c(0.593, 0.633)) # Data source #3

# Age
age_tb = tibble(age = c(&quot;18-29&quot;, &quot;30-49&quot;, &quot;50-64&quot;, &quot;65+&quot;),
                party_pref_age = c(28/58, 40/51, 51/45, 53/44), # Data source #1
                turnout_age = c(0.434, 0.569, 0.662, 0.714)) # Data source #2 (Note: age groups are different: 18-29, 30-44, 45-59, 60+)

# Race
race_tb = tibble(race = c(&quot;White&quot;, &quot;Black&quot;, &quot;Hispanic&quot;, &quot;Asian&quot;), 
                 party_pref_race = c(54/39, 6/91, 28/66, 23/65), # Data sources #1, #6
                 turnout_race = c(0.647, 0.599, 0.449, 0.339)) # Data sources #2, #5

race_tb_2008 = tibble(race = c(&quot;White&quot;, &quot;Black&quot;, &quot;Hispanic&quot;, &quot;Asian&quot;), 
                      turnout_race_2008 = c(0.652, 0.691, 0.465, 0.321)) # Data sources #2, #5</code></pre>
<p>Now using this information (party preference and turnout rate by demographic group) along with state-level demographic data, I can calculate the expected party preference for each state based solely on its demographics.</p>

<p>As it turns out, this gives me unrealistic results – what ends up happening is that states with larger white populations skew Republican and states with a larger minority populations skew Democratic. But this isn’t necessarily what happens in reality; some states like Vermont have predominantly white populations but tend to vote Democrat, while other states like Mississippi have much lower white populations but tend to vote Republican. There are many factors that can contribute to this, such as historical party preferences by regions or states, differences between states in terms of the urban versus rural makeup, and differences in other demographic factors like income and college education that have not been accounted for.</p>
</div>
<div id="state-bias-factor" class="section level2">
<h2>State bias factor</h2>
<p>To resolve this issue, I calculate what I call a “state bias” factor. I take the previously computed party preference based on demographic data and compare it to the actual presidential election results from 2016. The ratio of these two values is determined to be the state bias. For example, California’s predicted party preference is 0.65 and its ratio of GOP:Democratic votes is 0.53, so its state bias is 0.53/0.65 = 0.82. Since the state bias is less than 1, that means that California skews even more Democratic than what its demographics would suggest.</p>

<h2>Putting it all together</h2>
<p>Now I can compute what would have happened if everyone in the country had voted. For each state, I calculate its predicted party preference based on its demographics and assume a turnout rate of 100% (or any other counterfactual turnout rate). Then I take this predicted party preference and multiply it by the state bias to obtain a hypothetical election result. Below are the plots I displayed and discussed at the beginning of the post.</p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>I think what I’ve shown is a pretty reasonable ballpark hypothetical of what would happen if we increase voter turnout. However, I had to make a lot of decisions in my analysis, so there are caveats. I’ve listed as many as I could and grouped them into two categories: (1) analysis choices/assumptions and (2) data issues.</p>
<div id="analysis-choicesassumptions" class="section level3">
<h3>Analysis choices/assumptions</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>State-level analysis</strong>: I only used demographic data on a state-level. If I had more time, I could have done a district/county-level analysis (such data is available). In addition, Maine and Nebraska also assign electors based on congressional districts rather than the whole state.</li>
<li><strong>Uniform demographic behavior</strong>: I assume that turnout rates and party preferences by demographic groups were the same in all states.</li>
<li><strong>No interactions between demographics</strong>: When I compute turnout rates or party preferences, I assume that the numbers for sex, race, and age can be iteratively aggregated. For example, the turnout rate for an 18-year old Hispanic female is computed to be the mean of the turnout rate for the age group 18-25, the turnout rate for Hispanics, and the turnout rate for women. The party preference is aggregated by taking the product.</li>
<li><strong>Non-demographic factors</strong>: It’s a bit ridiculous to think that whether someone votes Democrat or Republican can be completely determined by their sex, race, and age. To some extent, I’ve addressed this with the quick and dirty solution of the “state bias” factor. I think this solution is sufficient for the purposes of demonstrating a hypothetical what-if scenario for the 2016 election. But if I were a political analyst working on the 2020 election, I would want to look at the polling data, for example.</li>
<li><strong>Non-voting population</strong>: I assume that the non-voting population votes exactly the same way as the voting population based on their demographics.</li>
<li><strong>No third party</strong>: I assume there are only 2 parties, so every party preference metric is calculated as a GOP:Democratic ratio.</li>
<li><strong>State bias factor</strong>: The state bias factor distorts the effect size of demographic changes in the voter base on the GOP vote percentage. However, in the scenarios I’m examining, the effect size of the demographic changes are small to begin with and the state bias factor is bounded, so the distortion is relatively small. In particular, the state bias for the four swing states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Florida are all between 0.96 and 1.33 and the difference in effect size with and without the state bias is at most 0.15% for these four states.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="data-issues" class="section level3">
<h3>Data issues</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Survey data</strong>: Party preferences and voter turnouts by demographics are based on surveys. Surveys can exhibit all sorts of bias (e.g. sampling bias, response bias).</li>
<li><strong>Voting-eligible population</strong>: The demographic data I use is based on the voting-age population. This is different from the voting-eligible population, since not all residents over the age of 18 are eligible to vote (e.g. non-citizens, felons depending on the state).</li>
<li><strong>Various data sources</strong>: The age groups don’t match exactly between data sources. The sources for different demographic variables and different races may be different. However, I’ve annotated every data source in the code comments for a reproducible analysis.</li>
